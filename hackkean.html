        <p>
          Projects can earn a total of 40 points. Points are divided into the
          following 4 categories (10 points each):
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Creativity:</strong> how novel is the team's project and
            execution of said project.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Functionality:</strong>how well does the project work. Does
            it have many bugs/issues?
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Presentation:</strong>how does the project look? If it
            involves users, does it have a user-friendly interface? If it
            involves research, how well does it convey the idea?
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Complexity:</strong>how in depth does the project go? How
            many functions does it have? How few libraries and external code
            does it use to get the job done?
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h1>FAQ</h1>
        <ul>
          <li><h3>What is a hackathon?</h3></li>
          <p>
            Hackathons are like marathons for coders. You get to build a project
            in a short amount of time. There are usually other things found
            within the hackathon such as workshops, games, networking
            opportunities, etc.
          </p>
          <li><h3>What do we do in HackKean?</h3></li>
          <p>
            You get to build a tech project of your choice. You are encouraged
            to be as creative as possible. Build a website for a made-up company
            that sells jetpacks, a video game where you play as a magical space
            ninja, or an AI that can control climate change. What you do is
            completely up to you.
          </p>
          <li><h3>How many teammates can I have?</h3></li>
          <p>You can make a team of up-to 3 students.</p>
          <li><h3>What if I can&#39;t finish my project on time?</h3></li>
          <p>
            That is fine, submit what you have. We want to include people from
            every skill level, and we understand that there might not be enough
            time to finish every project. Submitting something is better than
            nothing. Maybe you have a really cool idea? Maybe you were only
            missing minor details?
          </p>
          <li><h3>Is the event in person?</h3></li>
          <p>
            Due to concerns regarding Covid-19, we will hold the event remotely
            through Zoom and Slack.
          </p>
          <li><h3>How do I submit my project?</h3></li>
          <p>We will give you submission details on the day of the event.</p>
          <li><h3>What do I get from winning?</h3></li>
          <p>
            Firstly, you get the honor and bragging rights of being a hackathon
            winner. Secondly, you get a monetary prize distributed among your
            team members.
          </p>
          <li><h3>How many winners will there be?</h3></li>
          <p>
            There will be 3 winners: first, second and third place. Even if you
            donâ€™t win, participation is greatly encouraged. It will be a good
            thing to put on your resume giving you real coding experience and
            something to talk about in job interviews.
          </p>
        </ul>
        <h1>Guidelines</h1>
        <h2>Registration Guidelines</h2>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Participants must be students currently pursuing k-12 education, a
            graduate degree, or an undergraduate degree.
          </li>
          <li>
            Participants may register as a team of no more than 3 individuals.
            Prizes are to be shared among the individuals.
          </li>
          <li>
            Registration must be complete before the registration deadline on
            February 12th, unless stated otherwise by the Kean ACM team.
          </li>
        </ol>
        <h2>Participation Guidelines</h2>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Work must be done by the participants. If any outside sources are
            used (excluding public libraries or APIs), they are to be
            documented. You may use code snippets found online if the source is
            documented. Using code without including its source may result in
            your disqualification. Copying an entire project or most of a
            project may also result in disqualification.
          </li>
          <li>
            Be respectful to other participants. Bullying and harassment of
            other participants will not be tolerated and will result in
            immediate disqualification
          </li>
          <li>
            Recording of the event or any workshop is not allowed. Recordings
            may be provided later by the ACM, but participants are not to record
            the event or any workshop within the event.
          </li>
          <li>
            Do not share internal links and information without permission.
          </li>
          <li>
            Violating any of the above guidelines may result in
            disqualification. The decision to disqualify participants is
            ultimately up to Kean University and the Kean ACM team.
          </li>
        </ol>
